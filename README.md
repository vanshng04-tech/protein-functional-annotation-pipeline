# Functional Annotation and Evolutionary Analysis of a Human Homeobox Protein

## Overview
This repository contains a complete **in-silico functional annotation and evolutionary analysis** of a *Homo sapiens* Engrailed-type homeobox protein.  
The workflow integrates **query sequence filtering, BLAST-based homolog identification, conserved domain analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and phylogenetic analysis**.

All automated results were manually curated following best practices for homology-based protein annotation.

## Workflow
1. Query protein sequence filtering and validation  
2. Identification of homologous sequences using BLASTp  
3. Conserved domain and protein family annotation using InterProScan  
4. GO annotation and manual curation  
5. Multiple sequence alignment of homologs  
6. Phylogenetic tree construction from the MSA
